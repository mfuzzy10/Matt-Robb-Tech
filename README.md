# Matt-Robb-Tech

Hey im Matthew Robb and im 16 years old, i was born in southport,England but moved to edinburgh when i was 4 due to my dads job.
I have always been really into computers and pretended to code from a young age until learning it through school and getting better at my current language - python.
